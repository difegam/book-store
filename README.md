# Python Django - The Practical Guide - Data & models

This repository contains the code and resources for the "Data & models" session of the Python Django - The Practical Guide tutorial series provided by Academind - Maximilian Schwarzmüller.

In this session, you will learn how to:

- Create Django models to define database tables
- Create database tables using Django migrations
- Query the database using Django's querysets
- Create and update objects in the database using Django's ORM

The code in this repository includes examples and exercises that will help you to solidify your understanding of these concepts.

## Prerequisites

Before using the code in this repository, you should have a working installation of [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) on your system. If you need help with this, please refer to the official documentation for installation instructions.

## Usage

To use the code in this repository, simply clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/difegam/book-store.git
```

Then, navigate to the cloned directory and install the required dependencies:

```bash
cd book-store
poetry install
```

You can then run the Django development server to start the application:

```bash
poetry run python manage.py runserver
```

You should now be able to access the application by navigating to `http://localhost:8000/` in your web browser.
